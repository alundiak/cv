My Curriculum Vitae Project


# TODO
* Analyze existed Word/PDF Resume/CV, take pros/cons, interview questions, and rework it in better manner.
* Add resume URL from Google Drive
* Make "Download PDF". Try using node module for PDF export or create own.
* Get D3.js and create Skills Charts, with years and level and maybe people recognition (ported somehow from LinkedIn), etc.
* Maybe add "Motivation Letter" section.
* Maybe add section "My Ideal Company / Project" ported from wordpress article.

# Tech Notes

* It might be Markdown to Jekyll approach, but then it's limited development
* Also may be simple JavaScript/HTM/CSS development, which gives more benefits, when I have some ideas how to represent CV sections. But this approach doesn't work with bower_components (unless there is some deploy task on Github Pages)
* Maybe on TypeScript, maybe on Angular 4
* Maybe pure ES6, ES7, no transpiling.
* Maybe Webpack or RollupJS. or simply requireJS for modules if needed.
* Maybe fully responsive (as an idea of grid: https://medium.com/pixelpoint/handoffs-guide-for-pixel-perfect-design-part-ii-d91999742dd9)
